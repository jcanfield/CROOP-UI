# Synopsis

A Flat UI set powered by SASS / COMPASS

[Live Demo](http://www.croop.cl/UI)

Project has been worked on by various developers over the year. My goal is to integrate this as a 'Theme' to my fork of the ZURB Foundation. I've been working on a internal framework that is built-on SASS/Compass and take the basics of Foundation with Themable aspects so that I can just 'plug-in' the framework depending on the project. More on this soon.
